<h3>1.Why I choose Computer Graphics</h3>

	

<p>I choose Computer Graphics for three reasons:</p>
<p>The first and most important reason is that I can express my own idea by using beautiful and intresting figures.</p>
<p>The second reason is I only could use C++ effectively now, but I would use java in the class, I think it's a good way for me to practice more.</p>
<p>The last reason is that I could improve my math ability.</p>
